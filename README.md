# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

This Project aims to predict the demand for bike sharing services in Seoul, South Korea. Bike sharing services have become increasingly popular in recent years, providing an affordable and environmental friendly way to get around the city. However, bike sharing companies often struggle with balancing their inventory of bikes at each station, as demand for bikes can fluctuate greatly throughout the day.

To address this issue, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has provided data on the city's bike sharing system, including information on weather, time of day, and the number of bikes rented. This data has been used to build a machine learning model that predicts the number of bikes that will be rented at any given time.

The project was divided into several stages.

The first stage involved data inspection which included looking for missing values and duplicate values.

The next stage involved exploratory data analysis, where trends and patterns in the data were identified. Distribution of data was also studied.

Hypothesis Testing was performed on two hypothesis.

After this Feature selection and Preprocessing of data was done by converting categorical variables into numerical ones, splitting data and data scaling .

Furthur, various machine learning algorithms were tested on the split data that is trainig and test dataset, including Linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression and Random forests classifier.

The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error and mean absolute error and R squared. The Random forests classifier model was found to be the most accurate.

Overall, the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction Project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predicting demand for bike sharing services. By accurately predicting demand, bike sharing companies can optimize their inventory and provide better service to their customers.
